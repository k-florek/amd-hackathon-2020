    "q01":"It's the first question, this should be easy. In the picture shown, what is the name of the outgroup?",
    "q02":"This scavenger hunt is a blast!! What NCBI taxonomic id does this sequence belong to?",
    "q03":"The year is 2024 and yet another NGS based test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using a \"novel\" set of primers (based on ARTIC) has just been developed. It is up to you to save humanity and determine the sensitivity and specificity of this test. They have a set of 299 samples, and they test each sample twice. If the first and second test are discordant, a third test is performed. All the results are stored in the csv file, with a positive result (i.e. the gene amplified) denoted as 1, and a negative result (i.e. the gene did not amplify) denoted as 0.  Based on the initial results of Test1, what is the sensitivity and specificity of this test? Please provide your answer in the following format to exactly 3 decimal places: sensitivity,specificity i.e. 0.123,0.431. \n (For the purpose of this exercise, two concordant test results are considered a true value, and all positive and negative controls are assumed to have worked)",
    "q04":"You finished sequencing your first SARS-CoV-2 and are eager to gloat. Your rival laboratory has been able to sequence SARS-CoV-2 without the depth of coverage dropping below 5x. Ready to show off your skillz you begin looking through your data. How many positions have a depth of coverage below 5x in your first dataset?",
    "q05":"You are tasked with analyzing SARS-CoV-2 samples that were placed on an illumina sequencing run that included other high priority public health samples. You noticed one of the samples didn't generate a quality genome. It is likely contaminated but your taskmaster supervisor won't settle unless you identify the contamination.",
    "q06":"A recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 contains a mutation that appears to convey immune escape as a number of people in the outbreak appear to have had previous infections. Identify which protein has had significant changes among the outbreak strains compared to the reference obtained form previously circulating viruses.",
    "q07":"On Wednesday, September 9, a patient at Shady Pines nursing home came down with flu-like symptoms. A sample was taken, and the patient (patient A) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.  Two weeks later, multiple other residents have also been showing covid-19 symptoms. Thanks to a very sharp epidemiologist, all samples from symptomatic patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were sent to the state public health lab for sequencing and analysis.  A bioinformatician cleaned, aligned, and produced a set of genome sequences which they then assembled into a multi-fasta format. The index sample’s sequence is labeled sequence1 (this is the sample from patient A), and the rest of the samples are labeled sequence2-16. Based on the index sample (sequence1), which of the other samples appear to share a most recent common ancestor with sequence1? Please answer in numbers separated by commas (No spaces!) E.g. if sequence7 and sequence16 appear to be the most related to sequence1, the answer would be: 7,16",
    "q08":"You come into work one day to find your co-worker missing. When you check your email you find a poorly documented python script and some seemingly random chunk of dna. You co-worker was always cryptic about what was going on so you suspect there is a hidden message in the DNA. Although it seems they were better at encoding messages than programming as there are still some errors in the code. They were supposed to buy lunch today...",
    "q09":"You are working with an epidemiologist to investigate a small group of Covid-19 cases by sequencing and analyzing SARS-CoV-2 from the positive specimens of nine patients (Sequence1-9). The phylogenetic tree calculated from aligning the genomes (Tree 1) suggests some of the cases are related, in particular 4 genomes form a tight cluster (‘Sequence1-4’) that matches up with the contact tracing data. Together you decide to include some additional SARS-CoV-2 genomes recovered from a neighboring community and sequenced by a different lab (SequenceA-F) to determine if any cases there could be connected to this cluster. You incorporate the new genomes into your core SNP alignment and recalculate the tree (Tree 2) but the topology doesn’t look right and the cluster of interest is no longer clearly resolved.\n\n Which of the added genomes from the other laboratory in the alignment fasta are responsible for the new, erroneous topology?",
    "q10":"You are assisting a team of epidemiologists evaluating a sudden influx of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The team is having difficulty obtaining contact tracing information for cases diagnosed at nearby poulty farms and facilities. You decide to link poultry-related cases to their places of work. The list of potential exposure events are provided, as well as demographic details about each case.\n How many distinct clusters of 3 or more members are present?"
